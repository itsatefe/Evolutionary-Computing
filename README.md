HW1 -> 8-QUEEN with SGA (Simple Genetic Algorithm)

HW2 -> Road Alignment with GA (Finding best path from left to the right side of a multi-rough level map)

HW3 -> Schwefel and Ackley Function Optimization with Modern Evolutionary Strategy

HW4 -> Feature Selection with NSGAII and Adaptive Crossover Selection (The parent selection is not correctly implemented; it should utilize binary tournament selection. In cases of equal rank, priority should be given to individuals in less crowded regions, as determined by their higher crowding distance.)

Final Project -> An Adaptive Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Grid Subspaces
