HW1 -> 8-QUEEN with SGA (Simple Genetic Algorithm)

HW2 -> Road Alignment with GA (Finding best path from left to the right side of a multi-rough level map)

HW3 -> Schwefel and Ackley Function Optimization with Modern Evolutionary Strategy

HW4 -> Feature Selection with NSGAII and Adaptive Crossover Selection (parent selection is not correctly implemented, it should be binary tournament selection based on lesser rank or in the same rank situations based on lesser crowded region (higher crowding distance))

Final Project -> An Adaptive Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Grid Subspaces
